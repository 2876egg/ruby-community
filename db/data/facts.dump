24	abi	Each Ruby release has actually two versions, the interpreter version and the ABI version. The interpreter version is what commonly is referred to, like 2.1.5.

31	root	General advise in system administration: do not and that means never use sudo or root to "fix" things. Only use it if you exactly know why it would work and why it wouldn't work under any circumstances as normal user. Or if you're told to do it.	jhass!~jhass@aeshna.de	jhass	2015-05-08 16:10:17.415265-04

39	xy	it seems like you are asking for a specific solution to a problem, instead of asking about your problem. This often leads to bad solutions and increases frustration for you and those trying to help you.
