15:30 apeiros: ruby convention is: put all files in lib/, have names map the constants like Foo::BarBaz -> foo/barbaz.rb
15:31 apeiros: rails convention slightly deviates in that convention and uses Foo::BarBaz -> foo/bar_baz.rb

15:31 apeiros: while testing, make sure your $LOAD_PATH is set up properly, usually you do that by e.g. -I (capital i, not lowercase L): ruby -Ilib bin/your_executable

15:32 apeiros: and in the files, you require in each file what you need, relative to the lib dir. e.g. if foo.rb, which defines Foo, you need Foo::BarBaz, you have on top of the file `require 'foo/bar_baz.rb'`

15:32 apeiros: that's all.
15:32 prestorium: apeiros, hmmm what about appending '../lib' to $LOAD_PATH inside my bin/exe?
15:33 apeiros: generally should not do that since you'll want to make your thing a gem. and gem handles that for you.
15:33 apeiros: so fixing the $LOAD_PATH in the executable can be counterproductive.
15:34 apeiros: personally I use 2 lines of code in my exes, one which tests whether ../lib exists, and if so, adds it to $LOAD_PATH. that's borderline acceptable.
