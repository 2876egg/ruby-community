====================

* Approve of Code of Conduct
* Decide on Licenses (probably MIT & variant of Creative Commons)
* Decide on how incomming money is dispensed - in case the page will ever make money
* Decide on an organizational structure
* Decide on how contributors choose tasks and work on them
